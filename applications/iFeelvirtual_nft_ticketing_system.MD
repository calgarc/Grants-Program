PROJECT OVERVIEW: 
The iFeelvirtuel NFT ticketing system is a revolutionary concept that merges the worlds of event ticketing and blockchain technology. Unlike
traditional event ticketing system that are physical or digital copies, we aim to create NFT tickets which when used turn into unique digital assets. 
iFeelvirtuel delivers a substantial virtual encounter, immersing viewers in the core of the action and allowing them to experience emotions in a
way that remains unmatched by any other media. With our expertise spanning virtual reality technologies, 360° imaging in the Web3/Metaverse,
we craft immersive journeys that transport viewers into captivating virtual realms. Additionally, the platform offers immediate access for content
creators in the fields of Virtual Reality (VR) and 360 imaging, equipping them with the necessary tools to facilitate live streaming and on-demand
content hosting, while also catering to content creators, event promoters, and businesses alike. You can check out several of our projects on the
NearHub.online platforms. 
Objective: 
To leverage our team’s expertise in event management and blockchain technology to create innovative NFT ticketing solutions for VR/360 events.
Through strategic integration of blockchain, we aim to enhance event security, transparency, and the overall attendee experience. 
Target Audience Outcome: 
Event organizers and attendees will benefit from a revolutionized ticketing system that leverages blockchain technology. For organizers, the
solution ensures secure and fraud-resistant ticketing, while attendees enjoy an enhanced sense of ownership and exclusive access. This innovative
approach fosters trust, streamlines event planning, and contributes to the growth of the VR/360 event landscape. 
HOW OUR PROJECT RELATES TO THE MINTBASE / NEAR ECOSYSTEM 
The project fits into the ecosystem by serving as a bridge between event organizers and attendees through a transformative approach to event
ticketing by leveraging blockchain technology and the concept of NFTs. 
In the context of our NFT ticketing system built on NEAR, the project addresses several pressing needs within the event ticketing industry, offering
innovative solutions that significantly improve the overall experience for virtual spectators. 
In the context of an NFT ticketing system, the target audience encompasses a diverse range of stakeholders across the blockchain and event
industries. Each group plays a significant role in contributing to the success and adoption of the project: 
Event Organizers: The primary target audience includes event organizers seeking innovative and secure ticketing solutions. They can
benefit from the project’s technology by seamlessly integrating NFT-based ticketing into their events, enhancing security, reducing fraud,
and providing a more engaging event experience for their attendees.
Event Attendees: The project’s ultimate beneficiaries are event attendees who receive secure, unique, and verifiable NFT tickets. These
attendees benefit from increased confidence in ticket authenticity, simplified ticket transfers, and access to personalized event experiences. 
Personalization and Engagement: Event attendees seek personalized experiences that go beyond the entry to the event. The project fulfills this
need by enabling event organizers to personalize NFT tickets with attendee names, seat numbers, or even exclusive content. This enhances
engagement and makes the ticketing experience more memorable.

WHY OUR TEAM IS INTERESTED IN CREATING THIS PROJECT 
Our team is driven to harness blockchain technology’s transformative potential to revolutionize the VR/360 event ticketing landscape. By
seamlessly integrating NFTs into our ticketing system, we empower event creators and attendees with unprecedented benefits. 
The blockchain’s decentralized ledger ensures each NFT ticket’s authenticity and history, thwarting fraud, and scalping. This secure, immutable
record fosters trust and enhances the overall event experience. Leveraging blockchain’s scarcity concept, each NFT ticket becomes a unique asset,
amplifying its perceived value and encouraging early purchases. 
Our business’s focus on VR/360 events makes this blockchain integration a logical progression. The synergy between the immersive nature of VR
and the digital realm of NFTs amplifies the appeal. With interoperability possibilities, we envision a broader ecosystem where our solution
seamlessly interacts with other blockchain applications, expanding reach and functionalities.Being pioneers in this niche domain grants us an early-mover advantage, positioning our brand at the forefront of innovation. This endeavor
aligns with our commitment to technological advancement and redefines event ticketing for the modern era.
